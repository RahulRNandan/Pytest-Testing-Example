# Pytest Testing Example

This project demonstrates a simple example of using **Pytest**, a robust and highly recommended testing framework in Python. Pytest is trusted by both large organizations and individual developers due to its ease of use, powerful features, and flexible integration with various workflows and tools.

### Why Pytest?
Pytest is a popular testing framework for Python. It provides many features like easy-to-write tests, powerful assertions, flexible test discovery, and the ability to integrate with Continuous Integration (CI) tools. Some of the reasons Pytest is commonly used are:

- **Simplicity**: Write tests in a natural and easy-to-read format.
- **Powerful Assertions**: Pytest supports a wide variety of assertion methods, enabling comprehensive test coverage.
- **Automatic Test Discovery**: Test functions are discovered automatically based on naming conventions.
- **Flexible Fixtures**: Pytest’s fixture system enables resource management in tests.
- **Extensive Plugin Ecosystem**: Pytest supports plugins that extend its functionality, such as reporting or parallel testing.
